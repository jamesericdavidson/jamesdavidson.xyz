## What is Jibber Jabber with Jim?

I was interviewing [Brian Jepson](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5cQuh13KzwYBmE02MWhlhj) when he described what I do:

Telling human interest stories.

From the [human rights consultant](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1guEUllXybiOynmojmafzg) who witnessed the 2019 Hong Kong protests, to the [teacher](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02FJGX2ntLtM5YyKFNiRWr) who's transforming the way children revise.

### *Another* podcast? Really?

Your time is valuable - you want to gain insight, and hear fresh perspectives. All in under 60 minutes.

To deliver that, I speak to different guests about distinct topics. Week in, week out.

Make no mistake, my guests are 100% of the talent behind this podcast.
