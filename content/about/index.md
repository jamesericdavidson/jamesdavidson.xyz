## What is Jibber Jabber with Jim?

I was interviewing [Brian Jepson](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5cQuh13KzwYBmE02MWhlhj) when he described what I do:

Telling human interest stories.

From the [human rights consultant](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1guEUllXybiOynmojmafzg) who witnessed the 2019 Hong Kong protests, to the [teacher](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02FJGX2ntLtM5YyKFNiRWr) who's transforming the way children revise.

### *Another* podcast? Really?

I'm not interested in producing the three-hour roundtables you've seen elsewhere.

Your time is too valuable for that.

I work closely with guests to make every interview worth listening to.

Make no mistake - my guests are 100% of the talent behind this podcast.
