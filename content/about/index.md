## What is Jibber Jabber with Jim?

I was interviewing [Brian Jepson](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5cQuh13KzwYBmE02MWhlhj) when he described what I do:

Telling human interest stories.

From the [human rights consultant](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1guEUllXybiOynmojmafzg) who witnessed the 2019 Hong Kong protests, to the [teacher](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02FJGX2ntLtM5YyKFNiRWr) who's transforming the way children revise.

## *Another* podcast? Really?

I'm not interested in producing the three-hour roundtables you've seen elsewhere.

Your time is too valuable for that.

To make every interview worth absorbing, I collaborate with guests:

We hand-pick engaging topics of conversation, highlight unique perspectives on their specialism, and deliver the positive messages we want people to hear.

And I **love** the results.

## See you there!

Make no mistake - my guests are 100% of the talent behind this podcast.

I hope you enjoy listening as much as I enjoy producing.

Love,
Jim
