## Synopsis

My first project, written in the Autumn semester of the 2016/17 academic year. It employs HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

[View the source code](https://codeberg.org/jamesericdavidson/soft051-map-symbols/).

The goal of the game is to match the Ordnance Survey map symbol shown to the corresponding button.

## Retrospective

To win the game, the user must have five correct answers on the scoreboard.

* The symbol shown must be pseudo-randomly generated

    The `Math.Random()` function is used to assign a number between `1` and `10` to `Num`, which is used to select a symbol from `imgArray`.

    To avoid a symbol being repeated immediately, the value of `Num` is assigned to `PreviousNum`. If the values in both variables are equal, `RandNum()` assigns a new number to `Num`, until `Num` and `PreviousNum` are no longer equal.

* A star must be "turned on" when a correct answer is given

    A new game begin with all five stars "turned off". The game is won when they are all "turned on".

    Each button fires an `onClick()` event to the `CheckAnswer()` function, which passes the `id` variable.

    The values of `id` and `Num` are compared:

    - If they are equal, the answer is correct
    - Else, the answer is incorrect

* A corresponding sound and message should be used whenever an answer is given

    Example of a correct answer:

    ![The message "Well done!" is displayed](/images/map-symbols-correct.png)

    Example of an incorrect answer:

    ![The message "The correct answer is..." is displayed](/images/map-symbols-incorrect.png)
    
    The sound functionality was provided by the deprecated `<bgsound>` element, but now uses the modern `<audio>` element to emulate the same behaviour.

## Credits

The respective module was taught by Mark Dixon and Liz Stuart, whose approach to teaching made learning to program a joy.

## Synopsis

For context, Guild Wars 2 is a Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game (MMORPG).

A reward system was introduced into the game, which awarded player "pips" at five minutes intervals. The more pips a player receives, the faster they chip away at the total number of pips required to complete a tier.

The calculator estimates how long it would take a player to receive the rewards given upon the completion of a tier.

I was motivated to develop the tool as:

1. I wanted to use the functionality, and be able to share it with my friends

    It turns out that doing these calculations manually is boring. Who knew?

2. A similar tool had not yet been publicly announced

    The project had its first commit in September 2018, though it was functional from an earlier date.

    Since that time, at least two comparable tools are available. See the [Guild Wars 2 Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special:RunQuery/WvW_skirmish_pip_query?) and [LimitlessFX](https://gw2.limitlessfx.com/wvw/pips.php).

Much like [Map Symbols](#map-symbols-synopsis), this project was written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It is licensed using the Apache License 2.0.

## Retrospective

### Appearance

Pip Calculator is functional, but not beautiful.

It is naively responsive, using the `viewport` meta tag, and `max-width` body property.

### Functionality

The user enters a number of pips, optionally selects a tier to stop at, and is presented with the results.

Input is sanitised:

- `isNumberKey()`: The keys pressed must be between 0 and 9
- `isNumberAllowed()`: The value must be between 3 and 19

To ensure hours and minutes are displayed with or without plurals as appropriate, the `getCaseSwitch()` function is used to determine which strings should be used, using the values of `hours` and `minutes`.

### Flaws

The total time given is not equal to the additive time of each tier.

Tiers are presented with floored hours and rounded minutes. However, the decimal values of each tier are retained when adding `timeToTier` to `totalTime`.

Only after every tier is calculated does `totalTime` have its hours floored and minutes rounded. This results in the total time being longer.

## Credits

After playing Guild Wars 2 for thousands of hours, I have something to show for it professionally. Thanks, ArenaNet!

# dotfiles (2020)

## Synopsis

dotfiles was the latest incarnation of my 'configuration files and scripts for Debian GNU/Linux systems'.

It was designed to accompany a network install of Debian with all `tasksel` items de-selected.

The project encompasses two years of development in 2020 and 2021, though prior incarnations were available in 2018 and 2019 respectively.

It is licensed using the GNU Public Licence version 3 only.

[View the source code](https://codeberg.org/jamesericdavidson/dotfiles).

## Retrospective

dotfiles was discontinued after I moved from Debian [to openSUSE Tumbleweed](/posts/opensuse-security).

dotfiles was a moving target throughout development, as I changed tools, improved my understanding of the operating system, best practices within it, et cetera.

### Branching

I learned to use three types of branches for dotfiles: main, development, and \<feature>.

- main
    
    Once a milestone had been met, and the files had been tested, a release would be tagged. The tag would then be pushed to main.

- development

    Add complete features (see below) and bug fixes as atomic commits, ensuring they are trivial to revert.

- \<feature>

    Features were merged into the development branch using the `--squash` option.

    In the past, I had experienced broken files after committing incomplete features to the development branch. This was problematic, as I lived on the development branch.

    Adopting feature branches largely cured this error in judgement.

### Code quality

I endeavoured to make files easy to understand, portable across machines, and use programmatic logic.

As a case study, I will refer to [this Polybar launch script](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Polybar&oldid=578417#Running_with_WM) from the ArchWiki.

The script performs a naive check to see if the `polybar` process has been killed:

```bash
# Terminate already running bar instances
killall -q polybar

# Wait until the processes have been shut down
while pgrep -u $UID -x polybar >/dev/null; do sleep 1; done
```

What does this script do, and how can it be improved?

* Perform a command to search for the string `polybar` amongst processes running on the system
    - Use a bash-specific variable to check that the process was launched by the current user
* If the command exits successfully (i.e. the process is still running), wait for one second before issuing the same command again
* When the command eventually fails, assume that this means the string was not found, and that `polybar` is no longer running

```bash
if pgrep --euid "$(id --user --name)" --exact polybar
then
    # Kill existing polybar processes
    killall --quiet polybar
    # Wait for the processes to die
    wait $!
fi
```

* Improve readability by using GNU long options
* Check the user id by using a POSIX-compliant command
* Programmatically wait for the previous command to finish executing

Using the `wait` built-in solves the problems present in the `do-while` loop. The `if` statement can be exited immediately, and there is no reliance on nebulous parsing of another program's output.

There are many reasons not to parse human-readable output to a script, for example if `pgrep`:

* Experiences API or ABI changes
* Is not installed on the system
* Has been modified by the distribution maintainer

## Credits

dotfiles was integral to my learning process for GNU/Linux.

I'm grateful to every single person who collaborated on the documentation I scoured to make dotfiles better.

## Retrospective

### Why choose Hugo?

Hugo was chosen for two reasons:

1. To abstract the design process
2. To simplify content creation

A content management system such as WordPress is feature-rich, but complex. To my mind WordPress focuses on the following:

1. Providing a graphical user interface for the user and administrator
2. Enabling third-party developers to create themes, extensions and frameworks

For my purposes, I only require a theme. The fewer dependencies and code complexity, the better.

It just so happens that Hugo is among the most popular static site generators, alongside Jekyll and their ilk. Ergo, the third-party support, documentation and user-led discussion is readily available. 

### Choosing a theme

Many Hugo themes attempt to extend Hugo's humble aspirations as an SSG. Hence, a non-starter for my purposes.

I eventually stumbled onto [Gokarna](https://github.com/526avijitgupta/gokarna), a theme which is:

- Minimalistic
- Responsive
- Available in light and dark themes
- Configurable

Which suits my needs exactly. Most importantly, being a minimal theme, most "pure" Hugo documentation is applicable.

### Theme contributions

I've made modifications to Gokarna to suit my needs. Some of these have been merged upstream, including:

- [Support native front matter](https://github.com/526avijitgupta/gokarna/pull/109)

Pull requests which haven't been accepted appear in [my Gokarna fork](https://codeberg.org/jamesericdavidson/gokarna):

- Display a Licence Header in the footer
- Show the date a post was last modified
- Link to the previous and next post chronologically at the bottom of the page
