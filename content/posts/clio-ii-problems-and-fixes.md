# Introduction

The steps below are accurate for a right-hand drive Phase 2 model (June 2001 - 2005), otherwise known as the Facelift.

They may also apply to the Phase 1, Campus, Campus Sport, Renault Sport 172 and 182.

The forums can be a good source of information. I prefer the [Clio Sport](https://cliosport.net/) forum, but there are also the [Renault Forums](https://www.renaultforums.co.uk/).

Refer to the Owner's Handbook or Haynes Manual if you have them.

# The windscreen washer jets do not work

The windscreen washer pump and/or seal to the washer bottle has broken.

1. Pop the bonnet, using the handle on the left-hand side of the passenger's footwell

    Pull the lever to lift the bonnet, holding it up with the strut on the right-hand side.

2. Lift the plastic scuttle (below the windscreen washer fluid filler cap) to get to the washer bottle
	
	The windscreen wiper arm may be seized. Removing it is not needed to get access to the pump.

    There should be a plastic popper and screw securing the scuttle in place. Remove that first.

3. Lift the existing pump out out of the washer bottle, noting the orientation of the pump and hoses
	
	The pump itself - or the rubber seal - will be worn out:
	
	* The jets will sputter with a weak seal
	* The jet will stop working altogether with a bad pump and/or no seal

    Removing the pump from the washer bottle will cause the washer fluid to empty onto the ground

4. Remove the electrical connector and hoses from the existing pump

5. Reverse the process to install the new pump and seal

    Remember to fit the new seal, if not already fitted

Test the front and rear washer jets after topping up with washer fluid. Check for leaks.

# The airbag and SERV light are illuminated

Likely caused by the connectors underneath the passenger's seat, as this seat is often moved backwards and forwards.

To avoid going through all of the steps, use an OBD reader capable of reading Renault vehicle codes. Look for "airbag open circuit".

1. Check the airbag fuse, inside the passenger's door

    If the existing fuse is blown, replace it with a new fuse of the same amperage.

2. Replace and clean the contacts on the connectors

	1. Underneath the passenger's seat
		
        The grey and yellow connector is removed by levering the yellow part outwards with a flat headed screwdriver, until it pops out.

	2. Behind the steering wheel binnacle
	3. Underneath the driver's seat
	4. On the side of the passenger's seat (the thoracic airbag)

# The handbrake lever is wobbly

1. To access the screws on the rear of the trim, push the front seats as far forward as they will go
2. Use a T20 head to remove the screws on the left and right-hand side of the trim
3. Remove the trim (it may be push fit at the front)
4. Use a 10mm hex bolt to tighten the two nuts
    1. To get clearance for the rear nut: Disengage the handbrake, select first or reverse gear
    2. To get clearance for the forward nut: Engage the handbrake 
5. Reverse the process to re-assemble

# The front seat recline handle does not work

The inner plastic clips have broken.

Beware: non-OEM replacement parts may not fit.

1. Pry the inner plastic "ring" out from the existing handle using a small flat tool
2. Pull the existing handle out and sideways to remove
3. Pop the inner plastic out of the new handle
4. Push the new handle inward and sideways to install
5. Push the inner plastic back inside the new handle to secure it into the seat
