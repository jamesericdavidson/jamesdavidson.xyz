# Try it! {#try-it}

My first software project [Map Symbols](/demos/map-symbols) is now playable from the browser.

[Read more about the project](/software-projects/#map-symbols), [including a retrospective](/software-projects/#map-symbols-retrospective).

# How to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on Hugo {#how-to-use-html-css-and-javascript-on-hugo}

Hugo is a great tool. Pick a theme, configure it, then write posts and pages in Markdown.

But sometimes, you want to inject custom HTML, CSS or scripts into Hugo. This post doesn't cover *that*, but instead how to use these file types outright.

- Create a new directory in `/static/`

    In this case, `/static/demos/`.

- Place the project into the subdirectory

    A submodule of the [GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/jamesericdavidson/soft051-map-symbols) is used for simplicity.

And done! Nice. :sunglasses:
