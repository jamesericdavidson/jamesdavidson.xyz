# Downloading from Mixcloud

I recommend using [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) (or a frontend, such as [`tartube`](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/releases)) to download shows from Mixcloud, so you can listen to them offline.

# Radio Shows (2024)

## September 12th (2024-09-12)

An extravaganza of big band and swing from the 40s, 50s, and 60s.

Enjoy two hours of the classics. Featuring the likes of Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Dean Martin, Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby, Glenn Miller, and Bobby Darin.
