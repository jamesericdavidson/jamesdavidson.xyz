# JD the DJ Shows

## 2024-09-12: Big Band

An extravaganza of big band and swing music from the 40s, 50s, and 60s.

Delight in two hours of the classics, featuring Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Dean Martin, Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby, Glenn Miller, and Bobby Darin.

[Listen on Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/ferndale-ctg/fcr-radio-plymouth-presents-james-davidsons-random-radio-show-120924/), or play your favourite songs again [from the Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3KaivKAutRo8vVw1NybAIu?si=e2beb12b8369413b).

# Offline Listening

I recommend using [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) (or a frontend, such as [`tartube`](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/releases)) to download shows from Mixcloud.
